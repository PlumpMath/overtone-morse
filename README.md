# overtone-morse

A simple Morse code generator for Overtone. This is basically
a one-day Overtone learning exercise for a project which
involves generation and rendering of audio-range control streams,
so Morse seemed like a good feasibility candidate.

If any Overtone hackers feel like adding imitation shortwave radio
interference to this code, I've like to hear from you.

Morse decoding is beyond the scope of this exercise.
